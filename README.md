# Design Patterns in Go

This repository contains various implementations of design patterns in Go. Design patterns are essential solutions to recurring problems in software design. They provide proven solutions to commonly occurring problems and help in writing code that is maintainable, scalable, and reusable.

## Implemented Design Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern**
    - Description: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate by providing a wrapper with the required interface.

2. **Bridge Pattern**
    - Description: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. **Builder Pattern**
    - Description: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

4. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
    - Description: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

5. **Command Pattern**
    - Description: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

6. **Composite Pattern**
    - Description: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

7. **Decorator Pattern**
    - Description: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

8. **Facade Pattern**
    - Description: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

9. **Factory Method Pattern**
    - Description: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

10. **Flyweight Pattern**
    - Description: Minimizes memory usage and improves performance by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.

11. **Interpreter Pattern**
    - Description: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.

12. **Iterator Pattern**
    - Description: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

13. **Mediator Pattern**
    - Description: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows their interaction to vary independently.

14. **Memento Pattern**
    - Description: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation.

15. **Observer Pattern**
    - Description: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

16. **Prototype Pattern**
    - Description: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

17. **Proxy Pattern**
    - Description: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

18. **Singleton Pattern**
    - Description: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

19. **State Pattern**
    - Description: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

20. **Strategy Pattern**
    - Description: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

21. **Template Method Pattern**
    - Description: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

22. **Visitor Pattern**
    - Description: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
